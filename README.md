🌱 GoonForesters – Red Dot with a Green Heart

GoonForesters is a mobile app that incentivizes eco-friendly behavior through gamification and real-world environmental impact. By awarding Green Energy Points for sustainable actions like recycling and walking to work, users can grow virtual trees and contribute to reforestation efforts in Singapore.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Climate change, deforestation, and biodiversity loss are escalating. Global CO₂ emissions hit 36.3 billion tons in 2021, and over 10 million hectares of forest are lost annually. Despite Singapore’s green image, our individual carbon footprints remain high.

Many individuals want to help but lack accessible, engaging, and transparent tools to track and act on their environmental impact.

---

## 🌿 Motivation

Inspired by UN SDG 15: Life on Land, GoonForesters aims to:
- Combat land degradation
- Preserve biodiversity
- Promote community-driven sustainability

Our goal is to empower people to take eco-conscious actions and turn digital impact into real-world results like planting trees.
